# Mini Crystal

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/sVs1jQN.png)

Hi I'm a Computer Enngineering student, and I do this because I love crystal <3

Based on [The Crystal programming language](https://crystal-lang.org/)

This is an experiment to try new ideas for the language. (just like [mruby](http://mruby.org/)). This "mini-crystal" would be a compiler rewrite without stdlib, and just the language itself, with:

* [Crystal goals](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/#crystal)
* Incremental compilation.
* Windows support.
* Parallelism.

Why?
----

We love Crystal's efficiency for writing code.

We love Crystal's efficiency for running code.

We want Crystal to be Windows compatible.

We want Crystal to compile faster.

We want Crystal to support parallelism.

Oh, and we don't want to split Crystal community, **This is just an experiment!!!**

Status
------

* The project is in **pre-alpha stage**: nothing is done yet!!!
* The compiler is written in Crystal.
